# Path-Finding-Using-DFS-BFS
Created a program to find the path of an input word in a grid of letters, using BFS (Breadth-First Search) and DFS (Depth-First Search) Algorithms, which are also used in GPS Navigation Systems.

The starting location, in the form of row and column is given but that doesn't necessarily have to be the starting location of the word the program is looking for. THe return value is a string of rows and column tuples that represent the path of the word.
